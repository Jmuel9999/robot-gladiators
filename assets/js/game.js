var playerName = window.prompt("What is your robot's name?");//"what's the player name?" is the ANSWER for the variable

console.log(playerName);//allows to test our code without interrupting page with an alert

window.alert(playerName);//enters robot's name after it is declared in another pop up window
//Think of alerts as getting information to the USER, not to the developer

window.alert("This is an alert! JavaScript is running!");

// this creates a function named "fight"
function fight() {
    window.alert("The fight has begun!")
}

//fight(); // this is how to call a function, at the bottom of the js
