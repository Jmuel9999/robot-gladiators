var playerName = window.prompt("What is your robot's name?");//"what's the player name?" is the ANSWER for the variable
var playerHealth = 100;
var playerAttack = 10;

console.log(enemyName = "Roborto", enemyHealth = 50, enemyAttack = 12);

//var enemyName = "Roborto";
//var enemyHealth = 50;
//var enemyAttack = 12;

var fight = function() {
    window.alert("Welcome to Robot Gladiators!");
}

fight();

console.log(playerName);//allows to test our code without interrupting page with an alert
console.log("This logs a string, good for leaving yourself a message");
console.log(10 + 10);//this will do math and log 20
console.log("Our robot's name is " + playerName);

var name = "your name";
console.log(name);

window.alert(playerName);//enters robot's name after it is declared in another pop up window
//Think of alerts as getting information to the USER, not to the developer

window.alert("This is an alert! JavaScript is running!");

// this creates a function named "fight"
function fight() {
    window.alert("The fight has begun!")
}

//fight(); // this is how to call a function, at the bottom of the js
